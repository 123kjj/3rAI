    itemName: "Plastic Water Bottle",
    category: "Plastic packaging",
    bestAction: "reduce",
    confidence: 0.94,
    explanation:
      "Single-use bottles like this one add up fast. Switching to a reusable bottle prevents the need for hundreds of plastic bottles a year.",
    reduceAdvice:
      "Carry a refillable bottle and fill it at water fountains, cafes, or home. Most tap water in the US is tested more often than bottled water.",
    reuseAdvice:
      "Before recycling, this bottle can get a second life as a watering can, a small planter with drainage holes, or a bird feeder.",
    recycleAdvice:
      "Empty and rinse the bottle, then flatten it to save space. Most curbside programs accept #1 PET bottles — leave the cap on if your program says to.",
    reuseIdeas: [
      "Cut the bottom off and use it as a seedling starter pot",
      "Turn it into a self-watering planter for herbs",
      "Use as a portable pencil or brush holder for kids' desks",
      "Make a simple drip-irrigation spike for potted plants",
    ],
    environmentalImpact:
      "A single reusable bottle can offset roughly 150–200 disposable bottles over its lifetime.",
    localRuleWarning:
      "Curbside plastic recycling accepts #1 and #2 plastics in most areas, but rules vary — check your city's program before recycling.",

    itemName: "Cardboard Box",
    category: "Paper & cardboard",
    bestAction: "reuse",
    confidence: 0.91,
    explanation:
      "Cardboard is sturdy and easy to reuse several times before it needs to be recycled, especially for storage or shipping.",
    reduceAdvice:
      "When ordering online, choose consolidated shipping where possible to reduce the number of boxes that arrive at your door.",
    reuseAdvice:
      "Sturdy boxes are great for storage, moving, gifting, or as a base for a kids' craft project. Keep a few flattened for future shipping needs.",
    recycleAdvice:
      "Remove tape and labels, flatten completely, and keep dry. Wet or greasy cardboard (like pizza boxes) usually can't be recycled.",
    reuseIdeas: [
      "Flatten and use as a weed barrier under mulch in the garden",
      "Turn into a cat scratcher or play cave",
      "Use as drawer dividers or closet organizers",
      "Build a kids' fort, playhouse, or diorama",
      "Cut into shipping padding for your next package",
    ],
    environmentalImpact:
      "Reusing a box just twice before recycling roughly halves the demand for new cardboard from that item.",
    localRuleWarning:
      "Most municipal programs accept clean, dry cardboard — but sizes and pickup rules (like requiring it cut down) vary by location.",
  },
  {
    itemName: "Glass Jar",
    category: "Glass packaging",
    bestAction: "reuse",
    confidence: 0.96,
    explanation:
      "Glass jars are durable, don't absorb odors, and can be reused indefinitely at home before recycling is ever needed.",
    reduceAdvice:
      "Buy pantry staples like grains, nuts, or spices from bulk bins using your own jars where stores allow it.",
    reuseAdvice:
      "Once cleaned, glass jars work well for food storage, homemade gifts, or organizing small household items.",
    recycleAdvice:
      "Rinse thoroughly and remove the lid (metal lids are often recycled separately). Glass is infinitely recyclable without losing quality.",
    reuseIdeas: [
      "Use as an airtight container for pantry staples like rice or pasta",
      "Turn into a candle holder or small vase",
      "Fill with layered dry ingredients as a homemade gift",
      "Use as a bathroom organizer for cotton balls or Q-tips",
    ],
    environmentalImpact:
      "Glass can be recycled endlessly, but reusing a jar first avoids the energy cost of melting and reshaping it.",
    localRuleWarning:
      "Some curbside programs don't accept glass at all and require drop-off instead — this varies significantly by city.",
  },
  {
    itemName: "Old T-Shirt",
    category: "Textiles",
    bestAction: "reuse",
    confidence: 0.89,
    explanation:
      "Textiles are resource-intensive to produce and are not accepted in most curbside recycling, so reuse is almost always the better option.",
    reduceAdvice:
      "Buying fewer, higher-quality garments and repairing small tears extends a shirt's life and reduces textile waste overall.",
    reuseAdvice:
      "A shirt in good shape can be donated. If it's worn out, it still has plenty of life left as cleaning rags or craft material.",
    recycleAdvice:
      "Look for a textile recycling drop-off point — many clothing retailers and municipalities run take-back programs for worn-out fabric.",
    reuseIdeas: [
      "Cut into reusable cleaning rags or dust cloths",
      "Turn into a tote bag with a few simple stitches",
      "Repurpose into a pillow cover or quilt square",
      "Use strips as garden ties for climbing plants",
    ],
    environmentalImpact:
      "Producing one new cotton t-shirt uses roughly 700 gallons of water — reuse and repair avoid that cost entirely.",
    localRuleWarning:
      "Textiles rarely belong in curbside bins. Check for a dedicated fabric recycling or donation drop-off near you.",

  {
    itemName: "Aluminum Can",
    category: "Metal packaging",
    bestAction: "recycle",
    confidence: 0.97,
    explanation:
      "Aluminum is one of the most efficiently recyclable materials and can be back on shelves as a new can within weeks.",
    reduceAdvice:
      "Buying beverages in larger, multi-serving containers can reduce the total number of single-use cans used over time.",
    reuseAdvice:
      "Clean cans can be repurposed as small planters, pen holders, or lanterns before recycling if you want a craft project first.",
    recycleAdvice:
      "Rinse out any residue — you don't need to remove the label. Aluminum recycling saves about 95% of the energy needed to make new aluminum.",

      "Turn into a small herb planter with drainage holes punched in the bottom",
      "Use as a pencil or utensil holder",
      "Make a simple tealight lantern by punching a pattern into the sides",

    environmentalImpact:
      "Recycling one aluminum can saves enough energy to run a TV for about three hours.",
    localRuleWarning:
      "Aluminum is widely accepted curbside, but a few areas require cans to be taken to a redemption center instead — worth a quick check.",
